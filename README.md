# Kaggle Machine Learning Mastery 

This repository tracks my progress through the Kaggle "Intro to Machine Learning" curriculum. It contains data exploration, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using the Iowa House Prices dataset.

## Project Overview
The goal is to predict house prices based on various features like lot size, year built, and room count. This is a classic regression problem that serves as a foundation for understanding supervised learning.

## Skills & Tools
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn
- **Concepts:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Random Forests, and Model Validation.

## Repository Structure
- `intro-to-ml/`: Exercises and notebooks covering the basics of model building.
  - `01-initial-data-exploration.ipynb`: Loading data and basic statistics.
  - `02-first-model.ipynb`: Defining the target (y) and features (X).
- `data/`: (Optional) Folder containing raw or processed datasets (Note: check Kaggle terms before hosting data).

## Key Learnings
- **Data Exploration:** Using `.describe()` and `.head()` to understand data distributions.
- **Model Selection:** Moving from simple Decision Trees to more robust Random Forest models to reduce overfitting.
- **Optimization:** Fine-tuning tree depth to balance underfitting and overfitting.
